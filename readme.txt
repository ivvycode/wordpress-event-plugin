== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can the calendar be filtered to only show certain event types? =
At present, no. This is a feature we will be investigating in the future.

= Can I customise the look of the registration process? =
Yes you can. Using the CSS modification tool within Wordpress, you can modify the look of the registration page.

= Can I have the registration process on the homepage of my website. =
At present you cannot. The integration is designed to sit on the page it generates. This may be considered for future development.
